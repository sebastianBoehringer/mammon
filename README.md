# Mammon

A simple frontend intended to help me along with Vue 3 and stuff.

Mammon is intended to show you how much money was on your bank account at a certain point in time.
Basically a graph plotting the amount of money in the account over a given date.

There will be a backend so you add more entries

Expected functionality:
* Show a graph correlating the amount of money with a certain date.
* Show a total trend for the displayed timeframe. 
* Allow you to select a certain timeframe
* Input a new entry and send it to the backend
